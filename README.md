This is a demo React project to showcase some GitHub Action workflows.

## Getting Started

To use this project and test the GitHub Actions workflows, follow these steps:

### Fork this repository:

1. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of this repository
2. Select your GitHub account as the destination
3. After forking, clone your forked repository on your machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/github-actions-demo.git
   cd github-actions-demo
   ```

Now you can make changes to the workflows (found in `.github/workflows/`) and test them by creating pull requests in your own repository.
